# ECE148_Final_Project
## Jacob Ayers, Shoh Mollenkamp, and Ian Singon
Purpose - Github repository for the scripts involved in our team's UC San Diego Intro to Autonomous Vehicles course where we are building a robot that autonomously drives around a track using a human behavioral simulation oriented CNN architecture using the open-source DonkeyCar framework. Once the car is running, the scripts in this repository will be used to read in a feed from a webcam that feeds its images into an image recognition pipeline (live_predictions.py). We will place boxes around the track with famous musicians, the predictions from the Pytorch image recognition pipeline will be written to a text file. We read in those text file predictions (play_songs.py) and call a subprocess bash command to shuffle a song whenever the pipeline detects a new musician. In this repo we also have the training pipeline (training_pipeline.py) which reads in images based on our webcam training script (webcam_train.py).
